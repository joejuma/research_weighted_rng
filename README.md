# Research - Probabilistic Rolls

## About
This is a repo I used in studying probabilistic rolls, as part of an effort to study weighted random number generation. It primarily involves me exploring the nature of meta-probabilities, and resulted in a derivation of Bernoulli's Distribution's probabilistic mass function.
